Despite the old age, a lot of work has been put into adding additional armor and refining the base processes, such as an internal oxygen filter and the replacement of the visor. It's quite heavy, but a lot of soft material has been added to the inside to make the metal more comfy. Outdated, but can be expected in combat engagements to perform on par with modern equipment, due to the extensive modifications."
