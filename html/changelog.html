			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="wip">Covenant Corvette Fixes/Patch notes</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Fixed few mapping issues</li>
				<li class="maptweak">Tweaked and moved various rooms for better navigation (Grunt Barraks mainly)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Atmos Shields added on key ship bays (mainly on sec-storage as Mr.Beatz request) (again, sorry 4 the woopsie Mr.Beatz)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Edited medbay to hold it's own surgery tools n' more</li>

			<ul class="changes bgimages16">
				<li class="rscadd">Makes flood infestors able to heal and revive flood combat forms.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Allows hostile mobs to both attack and move, so simply running away should be less viable.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Allows flood combat forms to produce infestors, but only one can live at a time.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Tones down the effect of slipspade drive overloading. Sadly it's now just a really big explosion, but it shouldn't crash the server anymore.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the Cobra, outfitted to function as an anti-armour sniper vehicle.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds the URF Bull, an old halftrack chassis refitted to function as an APC with a mounted machine gun.</li>

				<li class="tweak">Gives T'voans a bit more health and pain resist, for the sake of balancing.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Makes vehicles able to carry crates (Pelican, Shadow and Spirit, currently.)</li>

				<li class="tweak">Lowers overall bomb resists on many armours, again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Adds ship scanning consoles which allow for the targeting of certain areas of a ship and a scan of the ship's overall superstructure strength. Due to lack of mapped targetable areas, no consoles are currently mapped in.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Rebalances explosions by adding an optional argument to the explosion proc, which, when used will ensure that within a set radius, an explosion will apply a flat amount of damage to contained mobs.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Applies the above changes to rocket launcher explosions and other explosion sources.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Makes vehicle have a psuedo-hud element that shows the number of people in a vehicle and their species.</li>

				<li class="rscadd">Step 1: Examine the components of the vehicle to assess the damage (Inspect Components verb)</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Step 2: Apply sheets of applicable material (Steel for UNSC + Innie, Nanolaminate for covvies).</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Step 3: Finalise the repair by using the tools shown in step 1 on the vehicle.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Step 3: Congrats, you've repaired a vehicle. Now don't break it again.</li>
				<li class="rscadd">Destroyed vehicles don't need to be repaired to full to be allowed to move again.</li>
				<li class="tweak">Fixes armour repair benches.</li>
